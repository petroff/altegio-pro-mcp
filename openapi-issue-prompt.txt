SUBJECT: OpenAPI Specification Issue - Missing Required Fields in Staff Creation Endpoint

Hello,

We discovered critical discrepancies between the OpenAPI specification and the actual Altegio API behavior for the staff creation endpoint.

ENDPOINT: POST /company/{company_id}/staff/quick
SPEC FILE: docs/altegio/en/paths/staff/api.location.staff.create_quick.yml

ISSUE:
The specification is MISSING 3 required fields that the API enforces:

1. user_email (string, required) - User email address
2. user_phone (string, required) - User phone number
3. is_user_invite (boolean, required) - User invitation flag

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
❌ Requests following the spec (without these fields) → API validation error
✅ Requests with all 7 fields (including the 3 missing ones) → Success

IMPACT:
Developers following the official OpenAPI documentation cannot successfully create staff members via API. This blocks:
- MCP/LLM integrations
- API client generation from spec
- Automated testing

REPRODUCTION:
1. Follow OpenAPI spec exactly (4 fields: name, specialization, position_id, phone_number)
2. Send POST request to /company/{id}/staff/quick
3. Result: API returns validation error requiring user_email, user_phone, is_user_invite

REQUEST:
Please update the OpenAPI specification to include these 3 required fields in:
- Request body schema
- Required fields array
- Parameter descriptions

Thank you for maintaining the API documentation.
